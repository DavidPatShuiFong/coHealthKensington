# Find 'duplicate' patient records in Best Practice

This script can be used from within Best Practice's Utilities-Search tool.

Matching criteria is found in the top section (e.g. *b1.dob=b2.dob*) and
near the end (e.g. *b1.firstname=apptid.firstname*).

The Only potential duplicate records listed are those where a patient has, or
had, an appointment with a specified provider within the specified time period.


```{sql code}
SELECT *
    FROM BPS_Patients AS b1
    INNER JOIN BPS_Patients AS b2 -- joint patient 'on itself'
    ON NOT b1.internalid = b2.internalid  -- but not the same row onto itself!
    AND b1.dob = b2.dob           -- match on date of birth and name
    AND b1.surname=b2.surname
    AND b1.firstname=b2.firstname

    INNER JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT firstname, surname, dob
    FROM Appointments AS appt
    INNER JOIN (VALUES('%bhagwat%'),('%fong%'),('%ekanayake%'),('%shoesmith%'),
            ('%plastow%'),('%samarawickrama%'),('%obeyesekere%'),('%chaves%'),
            ('%ryan%'),('%mikhail%'),('%haynes%'),('%buckwell%'),
            ('%grace ho%'),('%bullen%'),('%lambrou%'),('%zeigler%'),
            ('%tyrrell%'),('%summers%')) AS providers(Name) -- list of provider names
    ON dbo.BPSPayee(UserID) LIKE providers.Name
    INNER JOIN BPS_Patients AS b3
    ON appt.internalid = b3.internalid

    WHERE AppointmentDate BETWEEN '20181018' AND '20181025' -- appointment date range
    AND RecordStatus = 1          -- the patient may, or may not have, attended (yet)

    ) AS apptid
ON b1.firstname = apptid.firstname
AND b1.surname = apptid.surname
AND b1.dob = apptid.dob

ORDER BY apptid.surname, apptid.firstname
