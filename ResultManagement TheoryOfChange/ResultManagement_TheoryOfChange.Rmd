# Introduction

A 'Theory of Change' is described, where the goal of a timely action and discussion
of results follows from the 'input' of a clinician marking a result as requiring action.

Parallels are described between the theory of change and the recall flowchart shown
in draft version 2 of the recall procedures.

The relationship between some key stages of the theory of change and the **Current**
recall procedure are compared and contrasted with proposal to add reminders (**Proposal.A**).
Potential minimal changes to resolve the issues addressed by **Proposal.A** are
described in **Minimal.Change.B**.

Notes describe how to view lists of results which are marked as 'non-urgent' and
not yet notified.

Only a few relationships are described, with the letters **A**, **B** and **D** and numbers **1**, **2** and **3**.

# Relationship between Theory of Change and current, proposed or potential procedures

* **Current** : Recall system procedure for non-urgent results (2020 draft version 2)
* **Proposal.A** : Recall system using 'reminders' for non-urgent results
* **Minimal.Change.B** : Recall system based on **Current**, possible changes to fulfil aims of **Proposal.A**

# Notes

## List of results marked 'non-urgent' and not yet notified

### Follow up inbox (Best Practice)

From *Best Practice* main menu, choose **Clinical - Follow up inbox**

* Choose required date range
* Filter by action 'Non-urgent appointment'
* Filter by status 'Nil status' (i.e. not 'Given'/notified)
  + May *also* need to check 'Contacted' (by administration staff, but still not 'Given'/notified by clinician)
* Choose the clinician who 'checked' the result ('Checked by')

### GPstat! Result Management

*GPstat!* (written by David Fong) allows viewing of results, filtered
by clinician(s) seen, date range checked, action and actioned status. Comments attached
to the result, and upcoming appointments for the patient can also be viewed.
