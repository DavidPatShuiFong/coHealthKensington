# Introduction

A 'Theory of Change' is described, where the goal of a timely action and discussion
of results follows from the 'input' of a clinician marking a result as requiring action.

Parallels are described between the theory of change and the recall flowchart shown
in draft version 2 of the recall procedures.

The relationship between some key stages of the theory of change and the **Current**
recall procedure are compared and contrasted, and risks anticipated, with a proposal
to add reminders (**Proposal.A**). Potential minimal changes to resolve the issues
addressed by **Proposal.A** are described in **Minimal.Change.B**.

Notes describe how to view lists of results which are marked as 'non-urgent' and
not yet notified.

# Background

There are several elements involved in result management, including the:

* Stakeholders
  + Patient
  + Clinician (GP, RN)
  + Clinic staff (administrative support)
* Clinical information and practice management system (*Best Practice*)

Each of these elements hae a role to play in creating a system that is not just
safe, but also "*efficient, reliable and time-friendly*"
^[[“Protect Your Practice – Risk management/Tracking tests”](https://www.avant.org.au/PracticeManager/Protect-Your-Practice/Risk-management/Tracking-tests/)].

# Theory of Change

The Theory of Change explores the relationship between the goal of a timely action
and discussion of results following from the 'input' of a clinician marking a
result as requiring action and the prerequisites required for the goal to be
achieved.

## Logical framework

Closely related to the Theory of Change is the logical framework, describing
the stakeholders, inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and goal/impact (Table 1).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    Element = linebreak(
      align = "l",
      c(
        "Stakeholders",
        "Activities",
        "Outputs",
        "Outcomes",
        "Impact/Goal"
      )),
    Definition = linebreak(
      align = "l",
      c(
        "Who do these activities\n engage?",
        "What do we do?",
        "What do these activities\n produce?",
        "What do we hope they\n do next?",
        "How will that change\n the system?"
      )
    ),
    `Application.to.Result.Management` = linebreak(
      align = "l",
      c(
        "Patient; Clinicians (GP/RN);\n Administrative support;\n Management",
        paste(
          "Clinician marks result requiring action,\n indicating appropriate timeframe.\n",
          "Clinic staff identifies result requiring\n ensures patient has appropriate appointment\nto action result\n",
          "Clinician in contact with patient\nviews section of electronic medical record\n",
          "(Best practice) containing result requiring action"
        ),
        "Patient has time appropriate appointment\nfor action/discussion of result",
        "Time-appropriate action and\n discussion of results",
        "No results which should\n be followed-up are overlooked;\nresult management remains efficient"
      )
    )
  ),
  escape = FALSE,
  align = "lll",
  linesep = "\\addlinespace",
  caption = "Logical framework of result management"
) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T)
```

The links, relationships and pre-requisites between the elements of the logical
framework are shown graphically in the Theory of Change graph (Figure 1).

## Relationship between Theory of Change and Recall flowchart

Recall flowchart (Figure 2) from version 2 of draft recall procedure.

Only a few relationships are described, with the letters **A**, **B** and **D** and numbers **1**, **2** and **3**.

# Relationship between Theory of Change and current, proposed or potential procedures

The correlations between the Theory of Change and the current and proposed procedures
are compared and contrasted in Table 2. These procedures are further detailed below,
including issues resolved (compared to the **Current** draft version 2 procedure
for handling 'non-urgent' results) and hazards.

1. **Current** : Recall system procedure for non-urgent results (2020 draft version 2)
2. **Proposal.A** : Recall system using 'reminders' for non-urgent results
  + Resolution of issues, compared to **Current**
    - Increase the visibility of ‘non-urgent’ result to clinicians seeing the patient
      (Procedure 'C' in Figure 1 and Table 2)
    - Add a mechanism for clinical or administration staff to view lists of results
      which are marked as 'non-urgent' but not yet 'notified'/actioned.
      (Procedure 'B' in Figure 1 and Table 2)
      * When the patient has a result marked ‘non-urgent’ appointment,
        but does not have an appointment within the appropriate timeframe
      * When the result marked ‘non-urgent’ has still not been actioned/’notified’
        within an appropriate timeframe
  + Hazards associated with **Proposal.A**
    - Mark 'non-urgent' results with a 'reminder' (Table 2 : Procedure A)
      * Requires double-marking of 'non-urgent' result **and** double un-marking
        (Table 2: Procedures C and D), increasing procedural and time burden. 
        Risks reduced adherence to procedure.
      * Distinct process between clinician notifying 'non-urgent' and 'urgent'
        results (Table 2 : Procedure D). Increased cognitive burded. Risks
        reduced adherence to procedure.
      * Significantly distinct procedure between identifying 'non-urgent' and
        'urgent' results for administration staff (Table 1: Procedure B). Increased
        time required for administration staff to learn multiple procedures.
3. **Minimal.Change.B** : Recall system based on **Current**, possible changes
   to fulfil aims of **Proposal.A**
  * Increase visibility of result marked ‘non-urgent’
    + Optionally add an ‘action’ for results marked ‘non-urgent’
      * 'Action', unlike 'reminder', is viewed by clinicians but not administration
        staff. 'Action' is not used by administration (or other) staff to
        identify lists of patients with non-urgent results. As a consequence, the
        way the clinic identifies lists of results requiring action (Table 2 : Procedure B)
        is the same as **Current**.
      * Using 'Action', rather than 'reminder', would resolve the issue for those
        clinicians who feel the need for an extra safety-net (with regard to
        visual reminder that a result should be notified), without creating a
        universal administrative burden that affects other clinicians and/or
        administrative staff.
    + Use Doctor’s Control Panel to help identify that results are
      marked ‘non-urgent’, ‘discuss’ or ‘urgent’
    + As in **Current**, the ‘investigations’ page should be
      routinely checked by the clinician with every patient contact.
  * Mechanisms for clinical or administration staff to view results marked
    ‘non-urgent’ but not yet ‘notified’
    + Described in 'Notes : List of results marked "non-urgent" and not yet notified' (Section 5.1).
        - Can be done with ‘Follow up inbox’ (section 5.1.1). Which can also be
          used for results marked 'Urgent'. As a consequence, the way an
          administrative staff member or clinician identifies 'non-urgent' and
          'urgent' results (Table 2 : Procedures B and E) remains consistent
          and/or identical to **Current**.

# Notes

## List of results marked 'non-urgent' and not yet notified

### Follow up inbox (Best Practice)

From *Best Practice* main menu, choose **Clinical - Follow up inbox**

* Choose required date range
* Filter by action 'Non-urgent appointment'
* Filter by status 'Nil status' (i.e. not 'Given'/notified)
  + May *also* need to check 'Contacted' (by administration staff, but still not 'Given'/notified by clinician)
* Choose the clinician who 'checked' the result ('Checked by')

![Follow up inbox](FollowUp_Inbox.png){width=100%}

### GPstat! Result Management

*GPstat!* (written by David Fong) allows viewing of results, filtered
by clinician(s) seen, date range checked, action and actioned status. Comments attached
to the result, and upcoming appointments for the patient can also be viewed.
